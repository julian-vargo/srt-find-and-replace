# srt-find-and-replace
"Find and replace" feature for entire folders of .srt files.

Here are some potential use cases for this script

1) You have transcripts of a language with one kind of orthography and want to convert it into a different orthography
2) You want to remove accent marks
3) You want to bulk convert a specific piece of text
4) You want to remove .srt watermarks (eg. Subtitles generated by company.ai)
5) Any other cases where you want to use find and replace. Woohoo!

Script was primarily generated by ChatGPT and debugged or edited by Julian Vargo as a quick way to convert text

REQUESTS: If you'd like to find and replace a .TextGrid file, I'd be more than happy to adjust this script and make a textgrid-find-and-replace
